## I'm Chris, a Full Stack Web Developer. 

### Behold! A showcase of some of my recent projects.

***
[Itemized](https://github.com/ristopherCh/itemized) is a platform for aiding users in organizing and documenting their personal projects and all items associated with them. It was created as my front end capstone project for Nashville Software School's Web Developer bootcamp in February 2023, using React, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS.

[Bid Frenzy](https://github.com/ristopherCh/cs50-final-project) is an app which provides a marketplace where users can offer items for sale, as well as make, accept, and reject bids for those offers. It was created as my final project for CS50, Harvard's Introduction to Computer Science course offered on udemy.com, in December 2022. It was created with Python, Flask, Bootstrap, and HTML/CSS.

[Holiday Road](https://github.com/NSS-Day-Cohort-61/holiday-road-holiday-green-team) is a tool for gathering navigation and weather information for trips to and around National Parks. It was a 3 person group project, and a great opportunity to use GitHub Projects and the GitHub workflow of submitting and approving pull requests and keeping source code synced throughout the team.

It was created as a final project for PM 566, Introduction to Health Data Science at the Keck School of Medicine of USC. It was created with R, dplyr, ggplot2, and R markdown.
